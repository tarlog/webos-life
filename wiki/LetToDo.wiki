#summary Left to do

Left to do:
# Adjust it to both 400 and 480 resolutions.
# Create an icon.
# Allow save state and load it from file system
# After 3 is done, we can predefine some initial states.
# Improve design…
# Change cell’s size programmatically.
# QA
# Anything else?

Known bugs:
# The game doesn’t stop after all cells are dead.
# The grid may be not centered. It’s visible only for some cell sizes, but it can become an issue, if cells size would be allowed to be changed.
