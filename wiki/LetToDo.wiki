#summary Left to do

Left to do:
1.	Adjust it to both 400 and 480 resolutions.
2.	Create an icon.
3.	Allow save state and load it from file system
4.	After 3 is done, we can predefine some initial states.
5.	Improve design…
6.	Change cell’s size programmatically.
7.	QA
8.	Anything else?

Known bugs:
1.	The game doesn’t stop after all cells are dead.
2.	The grid may be not centered. It’s visible only for some cell sizes, but it can become an issue, if cells size would be allowed to be changed.
